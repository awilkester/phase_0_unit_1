// I worked by my lonesome on this challenge.

// Mission Title:

// DBC | Happy Hour in NYC Challenge!

// Your mission description:

/* Your mission is to walk through the streets of NYC with your DBC pair 
partner to the bar to get a beer. Your character is YOU! (Maybe we can pull in your avatar 
from Facebook or another social media site). You have 2 minutes to walk through the NYC 
streets (designed to be a maze) to the nearest bar. If you run out of time an alert will 
play that saying that Happy Hour is over and you have a new DBC project that you have to finish!
/*

// Pseudocode
// 1) Define the GUI game play area play as a simple box with a heigh and width that is 50%.
// 2) In order to creat the maze we will design horizontal and vertical columns by using div elements. 
// 3) Each div will have unique chracteristics with borders and no pass barriers that will create the NYC maze structure.
// 4) Use text elements to label streets, subways and other objects.
// 4) For simplicity we will have three main object: us, our pairing partner, and the bar.
// 5) Add the properties of name & position to all of our variables.
// 6) Add property of reaching the bar. (game over)
// 7) Start your avatar and your pairing partner at the DBC headquarter positioned on the bottom right hand corner, on coordinates (x,y)
// 8) Start DBC headquarters on coordinates (x,y)
// 9) Start NYC bar on coordinates (x,y)
// 9) Move avatar along different coordinate pathways (x,y) (imagine both avatar plus pairing partner move in a synchronized fashion, so it really acts as one object)

// Initial Code:

// this.DBC(avatar);
// this.move(avatar);
// this.bar(avatar);

// Refactored Code:

// No refactoring to report! (I bet there is, but after 30 mins of considering it I am not sure how I can make this better! [:<]    )

// Reflection:

/* I struggled a lot with this challenge and I found it very confusing/difficult to understand what level of ddetail we should go into 
for the initial descriptiona and the pseudo code. Part of this is that I don't fully understand Javascript yet. For some reason I am struggling 
with this material a lot more than I did with Ruby or HTML/CSS. I have already bought Eloquent Javascript and plan on going through this material 
more in-depth on my free time so I am not behind when DBC starts up.

In particular, I also struggled with understanding how best to use properties, objects and values. My pseudo code is not exactly what I want it to be, 
but I also recognize that through time and more concentraiton on the material I will be able to take a bigger deep dive into this element of my education.

Overall this challenge was a great experience and extremely humbling, as it was the first time this unit where I felt a little frustrated and panicked about 
finishing the material. I am happy that I was able to calm down, perform as best I could and find a solution that fits my learning needs (by buying the JS book, which was recommended by my instrcutor from GPS 2.1!)
