<b>Introduce yourself to your accountability group.</b>

My name is Austin Hay. I'm a second year master's student at Stanford getting a dual MS degree in Civil/Environmental Engineering and Management Science Engineering. I'm a native Californian and have spent all my life near the coast, so I'm pretty stoked to be seeing another coast this summer in NYC. 

Beyond DBC I am an active runner and avid gym goer, I love reading NYTimes, FastCompany, New Yorker and other major pubs, I trade stock options in my free time, I live for my morning cup of coffee, and most the time I'd rather be surfing or scuba diving.

<b>Describe what you learned from someone else's reflection.</b>

It was pretty relieving to see that all of us are 1.) struggling a ton, and 2.) learning even more! When I first entered DBC I had some idea of what I was getting in to, but I really didn't fully understand. This week has been such an amazing and difficult deep dive, but its helped connecting with others who are going through the same thing. I love to learn with y'all. :)

<b>Consider strategies for time management and productivity.</b>

My strategy is to treat DBC like any other class I would be taking this quarter. These assignments aren't graded (which is nice), but I am still holding myself to the highest standard possible. My goal is to spend as much time as possible without totally stressing out. I am willing to be a little stressed about getting my stuff done, but I find its pretty easy to crunch through these challenges if you start early. So for me its really about:

1.) Starting early in the week.
2.) Giving myself the time to explore tangent, but useful learning topics.
3.) Dedicating time to execute properly on the coding challenges and making sure to personally type as much code as possible! Reading is super awesome and useful, but the muscle memory of coding is equally as important. 

<b>Design a plan for getting work done during Phase 0.</b>

Normally I'm into plans and lots of structure, but I think my strategy above will cover me. I like to work hard and play hard, so I think the best plan of action is just to map each week as it comes. I am definitely going to search through all the topics at the beginning of the week to see how front/back loaded the challenges are. 

<b>Take a moment to reflect on reading other people's responses regarding their fears about DBC. How did that make you feel? Did you feel better, worse, or something else all together? How has your experience this week influenced your feelings? All feelings are welcome and ok. Just take a moment to think about it and write it down.</b>

See my response above: Honestly, it was just really relieving to see that all of us are 1.) struggling a ton, and 2.) learning even more!
