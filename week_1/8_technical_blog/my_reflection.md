<b>Reflect on the process of researching and writing a blog post. It doesn't have to be long. Did you enjoy this? Did you get comments or views? Did you find the blog helpful to your learning? Did you find it cumbersome? Which parts did you feel best about and which did you feel less certain about?</b>

This process was interesting, but extremely tedious. I enjoyed thinking about a lot of these questions, but having to write them all up on top of this weeks exercises was a bit exhausting. To be honest, I'm starting to feel burned out and only had the time to write about 1 website. I think this section of the week was the least helpful towards my development. It was a good thought exercise, but a tedious assignment -- I am just stating my honest feelings right now! Of course I appreciate the opportunity to improve even if I don't see the value right away :)
