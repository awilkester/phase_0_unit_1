## 6. [Wireframing](6_wireframing/readme.md) Reflection

<b>* What did you learn about design and user experience?</b>

The human-centered design process is something I have become very familiar with in my studies at Stanford, so it was really awesome applying what I know about product design to website building. At first it was a bit awkward since everything was digital and I was just sketching on a white-board, but after a bit it became natural. 

<b>* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)</b>

I loved it! It reminded me so much of the projects we map out in the d.School, but it was fun because I knew I had the tools and knowledge to actually BUILD what I was planning! Often in product design you map out your idea and then build a rough prototype with the materials on hand. What was really cool about prototyping and iterating in this project is that it was SUPER fast. Its very easy to set up a framework for a website very quickly with HTML5 and CSS3!

<b>* What questions did you ask during this challnge? What resources did you find to help you answer them? </b>

At this point I think I am very comfortable navigating the process of basic HTML and CSS. When I was setting up my wireframe HTML I wanted to create certain elements and arrange them in a particular way -- but of course I don't have the experience to execute immediately on these thoughts. So, I found myself googling different CSS and HTML codes in order to arrange my website in the way I wanted. I'm constantly learning.

<b>* What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what? </b>

I am still having trouble getting elements within elements to do everything I want. I also am still struggling how to make things "pretty." It seems like I have a good handle on the basics so I'm really looking forward to exploring others' code to see how I can put in some simple, clean and beautifying code. 

<b>* Did you learn any new skills or tricks?</b>

Lots! Check out my github work and you'll see most of them in the HTML files I created ;)

<b>* How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies for this challenge?</b>

I am pretty confident with the minimum competencies. I still think I have lots of room for improvement and mastery. I want to be able to develop profiency in executing on my wireframing better (ie being able to code out a basic HTML page from skill alone and without having to rely too much on google for support)

<b>* Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?</b>

I just loved the coding part -- that's been my favorite part of this whole week. It's totally empowering to spend a few minutes coding up and then see your work come to life almost immediately by opening it up in a browser!

<b>* Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?</b>

To be honest, the most tedious part of this challenge has been writing this reflection. I think a lot of these questions are pointed and very useful for reflecting on what I learned, but some of them are coming repetitive and I'm having trouble coming up with answers (I also don't like to make stuff up!)
