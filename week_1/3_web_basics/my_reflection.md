The two coolest things I learned were:

1.) VoIP is actually not just voice but it includes anything that would normally be done using a traditional telephone line that can now be done over the internet. It actually is kind of problematic since VoIP uses all broadband access to send and receive data -- which means its relient on the electrical grid staying up, unlike landlines. I never thought about how this might impact the world in the case of natural disasters!

2.) DNS is the coolest thing ever and it's so awesome to finally understand how the internet works and how that is different from the world wide web. I always knew that the internet was a giant amalgamation of connected networks, but I never fundamentally understood how computers have IPv4 addresses that literally reference their identity. I also got on a tangent and started researching nameservers and root nameservers. It is so wicked cool to think there are these 13 giant root nameserver clusters that hold up the internet as we know it. 

Some important things to remember:
-When setting up my HTML site there are client side and server side languages (HTML, CSS,JAVAscript, Flash, images vs PHP, Perl, Python, Ruby, .Net, Java, Coldfusion, Databses etc.) 
-Websites need: valid HTML, CSS, Javascript, meet accessibility standards, meet semantic guidelines, have valid metadata, have proper character encoding.
-Domain registration is around ~$15/year and domain hosting is around $50/year

It was SO COOL getting something I created on an index to read as a website. I know this only scratched the surface, but it was just cool to see how i was able to create a document on sublime and upload it to the internet. (And it also wasn't as crazy and scary as I thought it would be)

All of the concepts really came together better when I took the time to go off on tangents and explore terms and ideas that were unclear. For instance, in the DNS introduction section it mentioned root nameserver. I took an hour to go off and read more about the root nameservers, how to use nslookup -type=ns to contact a root nameserver and then figure out from there which nameserver had authoritative answers on a website's IP address. Wikipedia, again, was incredibly useful.
