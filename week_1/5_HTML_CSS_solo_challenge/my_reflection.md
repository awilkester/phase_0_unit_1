## 5. [HTML/CSS Solo Challenge](5_HTML_CSS_solo_challenge/readme.md) Reflection

<b>* What questions did you ask during this challnge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?</b> 

I think the most confusing part was going from Challenge 4 to Challenge 5 and not really fully understanding how the two deviated. I took a lot of time on Challenge 4 and went beyond the basic requirements to learn a LOT about HTML and CSS. Then in this solo challenge I was being asked to do specific things that I had already explored. I think it would be good to have an agenda list or a task structure at the beginning of the week. It would have saved me a lot of time!

<b>* What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?</b>

At first I didn't understand how classes and IDs could be applied properly. In my DBC1.html file I actually applied CSS to whole elements such as [p] and [h1] etc. When I learned more about classes and IDs I converted these to their appropriate form on DBC2.html. I still couldn't get some of my elements to be properly formatted. For instance my h1 title had a CSS code applied directly to it and I couldn't get it to be formatted with a division class or ID. I am hoping to figure this out soon. It would be useful to understand the flow of CSS application in the CSS document. I still don't fully understand it.

<b>* Did you learn any new skills or tricks?</b>

So many! I learned all the basics from the document and learned some cool tricks about creating tables and images. 

<b>* How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies for this challenge?</b>

Somewhat confident. I still don't know how to get a side-bar to work properly, but I got a navigation header at the top to work so I am okay with this compromise! :)

<b>* Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?</b>

I enjoyed everything. The learning experience is incredibly valuable. I most enjoyed actuallly coding up in HTML and CSS and gaining confidence in opening files through terminal, making changes, saving, git adding and pushing. At first I couldn't do it without looking at how to do it online and now I'm pretty proficient!

<b>* Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?</b>

I thought that the solo challenge was a bit repeitious after section 4. Section 4 and 5 were essentially the same, but just a deeper dive. I could have been better to combine the two parts... I felt a little burnt out towards the end of the solo challenge because seciton 4 was so intensive and then challenge 5 was just a deeper dive.
