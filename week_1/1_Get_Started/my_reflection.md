* Write an explanation of and compare git and GitHub to a non-technical audience. 
* Describe what version control is and how GitHub helps with it.
* Why do developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not?
* What doesn't make sense? What does?

Well the first struggle that I just experienced is that I wrote all my answers on this form and didn't commit before leaving the page, so now this is the second time I am writing these answers. I had no struggles setting up Git or GitHub

Git: is a revision control and source code management (SCM) system with high speeds and great compression abilities. At the basic level it is just an application that is installed on your computer that allows you to track changes made to any file or folder. It has its own unique sets of commands that allow a user to initialize tracking and map changes to data or docs or any other type of file

GitHub: is an online web platform that allows users to track, collaborate and share projects (code projects) using git as the main revision control system. So, in essence, git is the background software that allows the tracking and GitHub is the platform for sharing it.

Developers use version control (git) to track changes when projects have multiple users. Its like google docs for coding. Yes it makes sense. 

So I'm still struggling to get my head around how to USE git and github, but I now understand their differences and what they do.
