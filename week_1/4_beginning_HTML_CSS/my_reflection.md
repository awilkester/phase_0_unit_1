## 4.[Beginning HTML and CSS](4_beginning_HTML_CSS/readme.mc) Reflection

* What makes sense to your about HTML? What doesn't?

So far everything I have read and reviewed "makes sense." The most challenging part is figuring out how to make everything work just right on html and css. I still have some confusion how Javascript fits into this and how we might be able to develop site layouts that we can use over and over again. It also seems like there could be lots of opportunity for automation. 

* What seems good and bad about HTML?

The good thing about HTML is that it is a really powerful tool. The box model, however, in my opinion seems to make things very complicated -- but I don't want to speak too soon. I realize this is my first dip into HTML. I am excited to continue learning and becoming comfortable navigating this new language. 

* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?

Yes! When I first started I could hardly use the the notation properly, but after looking at lots of example code I started to see things more clearly. Like the previous comments I have said, things come together with a sufficient amount of time and dedication put towards learning and practicing the code.

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

Again, google is proving to be an excellent resource. I used all the other resources DBC suggested, but I just found Google as an amazing way to launch myself into writing CSS things that I first felt hesitant to attempt.
