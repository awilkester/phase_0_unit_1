## 2. [Open Source and Repo Setup](2_set_up_repo/readme.md) Reflection

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person
* Describe what open source means
* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
* Assess the importance of using licenses
* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

Creating a Repository:
The easiest way to create a repository is to head to Github.com, login, click on "create repository." To clone the repository on the local computer you can either use the Github GUI which has an easy "clone to local computer" button OR you can use terminal and type:

git clone [SSH url]

*for Github webpages:

git clone https://github.com/[USERNAME]/[USERNAME].github.io

For our website project we simply needed to create an index.html file and then in terminal push our file with git to github:

git add --all
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push

Open Source: Is the practice of sharing how a computer program was made and allowing anyone (or everyone) to customize the program and use it as they see fit. There are licenses and restrictions that curtail the degree to which users can use open source software. 

Open source seems pretty cool. It seems like a GREAT way to learn, but I think I have to get a better handle on things before I go diving into others' code. It also seems that you have to be somewhat careful with open source -- ie not posting really private or personal code that you wouldn't truly want to share with others. (so if I'm making the next twitter maybe keep it under wraps and not push it to github)

Licenses: Definitely important! There are a LOT of them and I think it's kind of overwhelming to look at them this early in my coding development. I took away the fact that when and if I decide to publish code I need to think long and hard about the type of license I want to use since it could give other users unlimited right to copy, use, distribute or even sell my code. 

I think the main concepts that set in were the differences between git and github and how to actually do something useful with them both! I am excited to continue learning more about how to use git and how to publish my work to github. 

I googled Git and GitHub and actually just read through the Wikis on them. I found this really useful.
