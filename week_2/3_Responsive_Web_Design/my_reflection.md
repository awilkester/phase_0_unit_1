# U1.W2: Responsive Design Reflection

<b>* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?</b>

Absolutely! Responsive web design is incredibly smart and useful. What would be the point in designing multiples of a webpage for technology that's ever changing! I think that the concept of responsive web design at first can sound a little "buzz-wordy", but after doing some more research it appears that there are lots of tangible strategies to implement into your HTML and CSS to make things work better on iPhone, tablet etc. Learning these strategies will be useful so I can adapt them to new technologies as they roll out.

<b>* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?</b>

They've completely changed web design by forcing designers to think critically about how their pages will display across a wide variety of screen sizes and web browsers. I believe this will only happen even more as devices adapt and new technologies enter the market. The web will become even more ubiquitious in everyday life, so I think its important for designers to be cognizant of how to design their pages initially to fit different screens and browsers. 

<b>* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?</b>

I have never actually by myself in the shoes of somebody who is visually impaired and relies on audio cues to hear the webpages that developers design. This understanding was really powerful and hit me hard when I started thinking about designing responsive websites. Visually impaired can and should be able to use the web as easily as anyone else and making code that gives easy to handle voiceover is fundamental in that task. I don't think developers are REQUIRED to develope their code in a way that serves this niche of society, but it's the right thing to do from a moral and intellectual world-view and something I hope to practice. 

<b>* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?</b>

Everything we have learned has resonated with me so far, but often times I think there are concepts that are talked about more than practiced. I think this is the reason why "Responsive Design" can become a buzz word -- because it captures an idea that is really important that non-desigers or technically adept programmers can understand and therefore is easily thrown around without the knowledge and tools that back it up. For instance, I was skeptical of the word until I read up on some pages about how it can be implemented through focused HTML and CSS. Seeing the lines of code behind the word made it become more realistic to me. I think that's the idea behind a lot of the ideas and concepts that at first I see as less important. I am just trying to keep an open mind with everything.
