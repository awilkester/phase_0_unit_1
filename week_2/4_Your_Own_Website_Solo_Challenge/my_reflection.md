# U1.W2: Design, User Experience, and creating your website Reflection

<b>Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience?</b> 

It's really difficutl to think about how a user is going to see the website without drawing some barebones of what it should look like and what content is going to be displayed. As a student of the design-thinking process, I think iterating and prototyping was so incredibly useful in this process and is something I am going to maintain throughout all my user-experience testing. I found I was able to work much faster by using tools like Dev Chrome, but also just by loading up the website and interacting with it -- seeing what worked and didn't-- and then writing out/drawing out what was needed to finish.

<b>* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)<b/>

I LOVED it. I had a blast. Even though it took most of my Saturday just to do the index and about html pages, I feel like I built a really robut framework to build the rest of my website on top of. I'm stoked.


<b>* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?</b>

My process was first to draw up my wireframe on my white board and think about what I wanted to build. First I thought about layout and what style I liked the most. I'm a pretty simple and visual person so I thought I wanted a few clean lines and great, stunning photos. Next, I thought about the content. I drew up the little links I wanted to post but I also thought about how I wanted them to sit, look and feel when a cursor ran over them. Once I knew what I wanted to do, I looked up all the resources that could help me do it. At first I was a little overwhelemd at where to begin, but I just deep dove into the social media links and got my feet going and from there took off. It became really easy to find the information I was looking for after several hours of being in the zone on it. What worked best? Just having a consistent bias for action and not getting frustrated when things didn't work. Persistence was really important in getting work-arounds for questionable CSS hacks haha.

<b>* What would you like to add or change about the site next?</b>

One thing I couldn't figure out was how to animate some of the links and icons without moving the whole div over. I tried fixing the child divs in place, but it still didn't work. I think this kind of stuff requires more advanced JS and animation tactis -- which I am really looking forward to doing soon!

<b>* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?</b>

At first I felt like I was drowning. We had learned SO much information and I didn't really remember everything. Once I got going, however, I realized that all the background reading was really essential in preparing me to search in a focused manner for the online information that helped me build each portion of my site. The research process in general was super cool -- there are so many great resources out there on the web. A few minutes of searching will almost ALWAYS get you on the right track for the CSS content.

<b>* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.</b>

Nothing specifically, just diligent research through google. I really loved the CSS websites that Dev already posted too!
