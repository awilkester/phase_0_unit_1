# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

<b>* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0?</b>

My biggest challenge is managing my graduate school classes and making sure to prioritize all aspects of the assignments before Sunday. What has seemed to be problematic, so far, is that I go off on tangetial learning and often don't stay focused on the assignment goals until much later on the week. This is great because I've learned a lot about a myriad of topics that have helped me on my assignments. The bad part is that I don't really get around to the actual work to turn in until very late on Sunday. 

<b>* How will you combat that?</b>

This will be easy to combat by continuing to structure my week and getting as much work done early in the week as possible. I also need to set goals for each Friday so that I do not overload on the weekends, which I have done twice in a row.

More importantly, I think I have come to terms with the fact that I won't be able to reach EVERY learning goal I want. Understanding my priorities and acknowledging which aspects are most important for me individually is a key step in this process. 

<b>* What techniques will you try?</b>
<ul>
	<li>I already meditate every day.</li>
	<li>I am dedicated to repetitive practice and persistence.</li>
	<li>I make the time to understand every bit of code I type.</li>
	<li>I never copy and paste code because that ruins the educational experience! And doesn't teach me anything.</li>
	<li>I know how to get into flow easily and I love doing it.</li>
	
<b>* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?</b>
<ol>
	<li>Read the intro and review all the week's assignments at the beginning of each week to understand the work load.</li>
	<li>Make a list of my week's priorities -- ask myself: What is most important that I take away from this week in terms of learning and in terms of skills?</li>
	<li>Every day read all the materials and start/finish the assignment and reflection for one section. There are usually 6-9 sections, so this matches up with roughly 1 per day.</li>
	<li>Work on things slowly each day -- two hours in the morning, two hours at night, if possible.<li>
	<li>When I can and want to commit extra time to Solo projects, do it. Otherwise, be realistic about my timing and dedicate how much I have at first. Scale up instead of scale back.</li>
</ol>
