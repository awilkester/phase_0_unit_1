# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

<b>* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?</b>

They seem incredibly important in making sure that there is some universiality to the way webpages are designed and interpretted. It seems like a good thing to have the W3C control the standards for HTML so that it is uniform and ubiquitious. It would be a nightmare otherwise!

<b>* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?<b/>

Yes, it makes sense because it is logical, clear, and easy to follow. HTML5 seems very intuitive and I had no problem understanding both the structure and some of the more recent changes -- like with semantic elements. 

<b>* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?</b>
Yes, I really like them! I think it makes coding even more simple and intuitive. Instead of reading code and seeing "divs" everywhere, now we are able to see the logical flow of the code, without compromising its functionality. 

<b>* Why is reset.css necessary?</b>

It resets the baseline values for the webpage so that the page looks the same regardless of which browser is displaying the HTML.

<b>* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?</b>

I use Chrome, and for a backup, Safari. Pages differ in their visual display and their functionality between the two. This is actually one of my biggest frustrations! Information should be displayed in the same manner across webpages to make sure its uniform and consistent. It would be terrible to design one website only to find that its not the same visual that was intended. 

<b>* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.</b>

While unrelated to HTML5, I did find a git resource <a href="http://pcottle.github.io/learnGitBranching/" >here</a> that was really awesome!
