# U1.W2: Chrome Dev Tools Challenge Reflection

<b>* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?</b>

DOM is a programming interface for XML and HTML, but it is not a programming language. It views a web-page as a fully-object oriented document and allows all the elements within said document to be accessed and manipulated. It really helped to think about DOM as a foundation for the creation of events, properties and methods. Objects can be viewed visually as nodes -- as we saw in Dev Chrome Tools. Once I started using Dev Chrome tools all these concepts began to make much better sense. It seems awesome for a ubiquitous way to manipulate webpages and make rapid iterations. The bad part is it is universal and is probably regulated so I bet there are complaints about its full functionality (although it seems effective to me)

<b>* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?</b>

Wordpress.com was a lot more complicated than mine! There are so many CSS and JS files that go into wordpress sites. 

<b>* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?</b>

It was kinda a pain. It seemed impossible to click exactly on the right elements and boxes. The text was small and it seemed buggy -- for instance sometimes things would blink and jump around. It did not seem like a smooth technical analysis experience. Personally, I got a little annoyed and frustrated. I think the frustrating part, however, was from Code School because it never registered any of my actions, even when they were correct.

<b>* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?</b>

I am still working on learning DOM. I guess I'm having some trouble fundamentally understanding what it physcially is, ie where is it stored, how is it accessed etc. I understand what it does and why it's important, but I just don't really get where it exists in the computer (I know that sounds super n00b)

<b>* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.</b>

Again, google is my main access point. I will try to do a better job of recording my sources and then sharing them in my reflections moving forward.
