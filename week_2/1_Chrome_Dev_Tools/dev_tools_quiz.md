##QUIZ
<b>* Explain which tabs support the following actions and how.</b>
  <b>* Realtime editing of HTML and CSS</b>
  <b>* Javascript Debugging</b>
  <b>* Performance Optimization</b>

  1.) Elements and sources tabs.
  2.) Console tab.
  3.) Network tab and, more specifically, Timeline tab.

<b>* What's the quick key for your OS to spawn the Dev Tools inspector?</b>

OS X = Option+Command+I
Windows = Control+Shift+I (?)

<b>* Go to http://www.postmachina.com/ and analyze and tweak this nicely designed page.</b>

<b>* What is the current background color for the page?  (Surprisingly, it's not just black!)</b>
  Color is #0b0f11.

<b>* Tweak the background color to white.</b>
  Done.

<b>* Tweak the height of the side bar that contains the logo.  Shrink it down to 85px.</b>
  Done.

<b>* Roll over the navigation links.  When you hover over them, they dissapear.  Let's change the hover color to black instead.</b>
  Done.

<b>* Now take a screenshot of your new (and maybe not so improved) design.  It should match this screenshot: http://postimg.org/image/5ak1jkpl5/</b>
  Done.

<b>* Upload your own image to the web using an image hosting service.  It should match the image above. The last nav link in the image above is black because the mouse was hovering there when the screenshot was taken. Do the same, and don't take a screenshot of your whole desktop, just the browser window. (This is part of the challenge.)</b>

<b>* For the postmachina website, why can't you tweak the color of the text "The most important things are not things"?  Please explain.</b>

The text is a .gif file.

<b>* Go to www.ticketswizard.com and analyze the page.</b>

Over 70 requests which took ~3 seconds to load. Most of them are CSS files.

<b>* What is the largest image on the website?</b>

The largest file is a picture of Times Square (on what appears to be NYE). It is 316 KB.

<b>* Explain how you would find out this information, and list the URL of offending image here and how big it is.</b>

I found the largest file by running Chrome Dev Tools, clearing the panel, refreshing the website, and then sorting the paths by size. The first image to come up on the list of paths ranked in descending size is the biggest image on the website. URL <a href"http://www.ticketswizard.com/Images/Catalog/92624182-c482-4a35-8da2-4fbf2f502e94_Large_Large.png">here.</a>

<b>* Test the www.ticketswizard.com website with google's [PageSpeed Insights](http://www.ticketswizard.com/).  (You can also download the chrome plugin).  What is the lowest hanging fruit to optimize the website?  How many kilobytes of data can be eliminated?</b>

Optimizng the images can reduce their size by over 40%, so this is the lowest hanging fruit in my opinion.
